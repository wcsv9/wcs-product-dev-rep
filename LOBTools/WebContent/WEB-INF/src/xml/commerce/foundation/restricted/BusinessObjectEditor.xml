<Definitions>
	<!---
		The cmc/foundation/BusinessObjectEditor class is the base class for all Management Center tools.
		The business object editor includes support for the menu, toolbar, search widget, explorer view 
		and utilities view. It is responsible for managing all user interactions that allow the user to
		edit the business objects declared with this business object editor. Instances of this class should
		not be instantiated directly. They must be registered by adding an instance of {@link cmc/foundation/ApplicationMenuItem}
		to {@link cmc/foundation/ApplicationMenuItems}.
		
		<p>A single instance of {@link cmc/foundation/TopObjectDefinition} must be declared as a child of every business object editor.
		When the business object editor is initialized, an instance of this top object will be instantiated.
		If the top object definition includes a template dataset then the organizational objects declared in the dataset
		will be instantiated as children of the top object. If the top object children declares one or more
		{@link cmc/foundation/GetChildrenService} instances, then the get children services will be invoked to load the top
		object's child objects. Child objects under the top object instance will be displayed in the explorer tree
		below the "Active Work" node. The child objects under the top object instance will also be visible in the
		utilities view browse tab.
		
		<p>At least one instance of {@link cmc/foundation/Filter} must be declared as a child of every business object editor.
		This filter will be used to filter the objects displayed in the explorer view and utilities view browse tab.
		If more than one filter is declared, then a filter selector drop-down will be visible in the explorer view
		and in the utilities view browse tab. The filter selector will allow the user to change the set of objects
		that are currently visible. When declaring a filter for a business object editor that allows the display of
		{@link cmc/foundation/PrimaryObjectDefinition primary objects} as children of the top object, it is important to realize
		that the objects displayed in the tree below these top level primary objects will all be
		{@link cmc/foundation/ReferenceObjectDefinition reference objects} or {@link cmc/foundation/ParentReferenceObjectDefinition parent reference objects}.
		The object types used in the declaration of a {@link cmc/foundation/ObjectTypeFilter} instance must include both the primary
		object types and the reference object types or nothing below the top level primary objects will be visible.

		<p>Multiple instances of {@link cmc/foundation/OrganizationalObjectDefinition} can be declared as children of a business 
		object editor. The only way that organization objects can be instantiated is by declaring
		them in the template dataset of the top object definition or of another organizational object definition.
		
		<p>At least one instance of {@link cmc/foundation/PrimaryObjectDefinition} must be declared as a child of every business
		object editor. There must be a primary object definition for every type of business object that can be returned
		through a search request or can be located by browsing for objects through the explorer view or utilities view.
		If the business object editor allows the creation of new business objects, then the corresponding primary object
		definitions must have their "creatable" attribute set to "true".
		
		<p>Multiple instances of {@link cmc/foundation/InitService} can be declared as children of a business object editor.
		If new context values were declared, then at lease one initialization service must be declared to populate
		the context values. Any declared initialization services will be invoked when the business object editor
		is initialized or a new store is selected.
		
		<p>Multiple instances of {@link cmc/foundation/SearchDefinition} can be declared as children of a business object editor.
		The search definitions will be used to populate the list of search types available from the search area and utilities
		view search tab.
