<Definitions>

	<!---			
		This service creates an object on the WebSphere Commerce
		server by invoking the URL specified in the <code>url</code> 
		attribute. Every property that is part of the object will be 
		passed as a parameter to the URL.  Additional parameters can be
		added to the request by declaring {@link cmc/foundation/ServiceParam} instances
		as children of the cmc/foundation/CreateService instance.
		
		<p>This service will only be invoked when the object is a
		new object that has not yet been persisted to the server. Objects
		that already have a server representation will be saved using
		{@link cmc/foundation/UpdateService}.
	
		<p>A create service may only be declared as a child
		of an instance of {@link cmc/foundation/ObjectDefinition}. 
		
		<p>If the object is created successfully, a status message will be displayed 
		in the message logger and any properties returned in the response
		will be added to the cmc/foundation/ModelObject instance associated with
		the request.  If the creation fails, the 
		error message returned by the request will be displayed
		in the message logger.

		<p>Any validation error returned by the request will also be displayed to the
		business user.

		<p>The following example demonstrates the declaration of a create service.
		The service includes an explicity declared service parameter that sends
		the store identifier. The store identifier is resolved from the "storeId"
		context value. When the service request is invoked,
		all properties associated with the new business object will be included
		as implicit parameters.
		
		@START_CODE
		<CreateService url="/cmc/CreateMyObject">
			<ServiceParam name="storeId"/>
		</CreateService>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>The successful response from a create service must be an XML document
		that has "object" as the name of the root element. If the response document includes
		properties, then the properties will be applied to the client side representation
		of the business object. Create services must return an updated ID property
		value. This is required to ensure that the client side cache of business
		objects remains consistent in the event that the newly persisted business object
		is reloaded from the server through another operation.
		
		<p>The following sample demonstrates the expected format
		for a successful response. It includes updated values for the properties named
		"objectId" and "objectStoreId".

		@START_CODE
		<object>
			<objectId>111</objectId>
			<objectStoreId>10101</objectStoreId>
		</object>
		@END_CODE

		<p>When CMC is e-site enabled, the successful response must include the <code>objectStoreId</code> property if:
		<ul>
			<li>The create service saves a {@link cmc/foundation/ChildObjectDefinition child object} whose store ID is
			<b>different</b> from the parent object. For example, when you add a local offer price to an
			inherited catalog entry.</li>
			<li>The create service saves a {@link cmc/foundation/ReferenceObjectDefinition reference object} whose store ID is
			different from the parent object. For example, when you add a local merchandising association to an
			inherited catalog entry.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The framework uses the <code>objectStoreId</code> property to determine if the current user is authorized
		to edit an object. If no <code>objectStoreId</code> is returned in the response, then the framework will assume that the
		object belongs to the same store as the object's parent. If the user does not have edit authority to the parent object, then
		he won't be able to edit the new child object either.
		
		<p>If the request is not successful, then the response must be an XML document
		that has "errors" as the name of the root element. The XML document must include
		at least one element named "validationError" or an element named "exception". Validation
		errors should be returned if the problem can be corrected by the business user. An example
		of a validation error is a missing required parameter. Validation errors can either be "property"
		level validation errors or "object" level validation errors. Property level validation errors
		include the name of the specific property that was found to be a problem. Object level validation
		errors do not include a property name and are not mapped to a specific problem.
		An exception should be returned if the problem cannot be corrected by the business user.
		An example of an exception is the user does not have the required access rights to perform
		the action.
		
		<p>The following sample demonstrates an error response that includes an object level validation
		error and a property level validation error.
		
		@START_CODE
		<errors>
			<validationError propertyName="name">Name is a required property.</validationError>
			<validationError>The product could not be saved. Refer to the message logger for more details.</validationError>
		</errors>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>The following sample demonstrates an error response that includes an exception.
		
		@START_CODE
		<errors>
			<exception>You do not have the correct access rights to complete this save operation.</exception>
		</errors>
		@END_CODE
