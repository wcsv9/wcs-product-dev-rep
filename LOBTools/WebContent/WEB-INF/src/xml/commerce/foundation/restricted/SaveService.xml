		This service updates an object on the WebSphere Commerce
		server by invoking the URL specified in the <code>url</code> 
		attribute. Every property that is part of the object that is dirty
		will be passed as a parameter to the URL.  Additional parameters can be
		added to the request by declaring {@link cmc/foundation/ServiceParam} instances
		as children of the cmc/foundation/UpdateService instance.
		
		<p>This service is only used to update objects that have already been
		persisted to the server. New objects will be persisted using {@link cmc/foundation/CreateService}.
	
		<p>An update service may only be declared as a child
		of an instance of {@link cmc/foundation/ObjectDefinition}. 
		
		<p>If the object is updated successfully, a status message will be displayed 
		in the message logger, and the object will be marked as not dirty.
		If the updates fails, the error message returned by the URL displays 
		in the message logger and the object will stay dirty.
		
		<p>Any validation error returned by the url will also be displayed to the
		business user.

		<p>The following example demonstrates the declaration of an update service.
		The service includes one explicity declared service parameter that sends
		a parameter called "objectId". The parameter value is retrieved from the
		object property named "objectId". When the service request is invoked,
		any dirty property associated with the business object will be included
		as implicit parameters.
			
		@START_CODE
		<UpdateService url="/cmc/UpdateMyObject">
			<ServiceParam name="objectId" propertyName="objectId"/>
		</UpdateService>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>The successful response from an update service must be an XML document
		that has "object" as the name of the root element. If the response document includes
		properties, then the properties will be applied to the client side representation
		of the business object.  Update services do not typically need to return
		updated property values. An updated property is only required if
		the act of persisting the changes causes a change to the value of one
		of the object properties. The following sample demonstrates the expected format
		for a successful response. It includes an updated value for the property named
		"objectId".
			
		@START_CODE
		<object>
			<objectId>111</objectId>
		</object>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>If the request is not successful, then the response must be an XML document
		that has "errors" as the name of the root element. The XML document must include
		at least one element named "validationError" or an element named "exception". Validation
		errors should be returned if the problem can be corrected by the business user. An example
		of a validation error is a missing required parameter. Validation errors can either be "property"
		level validation errors or "object" level validation errors. Property level validation errors
		include the name of the specific property that was found to be a problem. Object level validation
		errors do not include a property name and are not mapped to a specific problem.
		An exception should be returned if the problem cannot be corrected by the business user.
		An example of an exception is the user does not have the required access rights to perform
		the action.
		
		<p>The following sample demonstrates an error response that includes an object level validation
		error and a property level validation error.
		
		@START_CODE
		<errors>
			<validationError propertyName="name">Name is a required property.</validationError>
			<validationError>The product could not be saved. Refer to the message logger for more details.</validationError>
		</errors>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>The following sample demonstrates an error response that includes an exception.
		
		@START_CODE
		<errors>
			<exception>You do not have the correct access rights to complete this save operation.</exception>
		</errors>
		@END_CODE
